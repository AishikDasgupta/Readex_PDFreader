They\\ncontinue to fill factory floors and manufacturing plants, but now their\\ncapabilities extend beyond manual activities to cognitive tasks that, until\\nrecently, only humans were capable of performing. Judging song\\ncompetitions, driving automobiles, and mopping the floor with professional\\nchess players are three examples of the specific complex tasks machines are\\nnow capable of simulating.\\nBut their remarkable feats trigger fear among some observers. Part of this\\nfear nestles on the neck of survivalist insecurities, where it provokes the\\ndeep-seated question of \\nwhat if\\n? \\nWhat if\\n intelligent machines turn on us in a\\nstruggle of the fittest? \\nWhat if\\n intelligent machines produce offspring with\\ncapabilities that humans never intended to impart to machines? \\nWhat if\\n the\\nlegend of the \\nsingularity\\n is true?\\nThe other notable fear is the threat to job security, and if you’re a truck driver\\nor an accountant, there is a valid reason to be worried. According to the\\nBritish Broadcasting Company’s (BBC) interactive online resource \\nWill a\\nrobot take my job?\\n, professions such as bar worker (77%), waiter (90%),\\nchartered accountant (95%), receptionist (96%), and taxi driver (57%) each\\nhave a high chance of becoming automated by the year 2035.\\n[1]\\nBut research on planned job automation and crystal ball gazing with respect\\nto the future evolution of machines and artificial intelligence (AI) should be\\nread with a pinch of skepticism. AI technology is moving fast, but broad\\nadoption is still an unchartered path fraught with known and unforeseen\\nchallenges. Delays and other obstacles are inevitable.\\nNor is machine learning a simple case of flicking a switch and asking the\\nmachine to predict the outcome of the Super Bowl and serve you a delicious\\nmartini. Machine learning is far from what you would call an out-of-the-box\\nsolution.\\nMachines operate based on statistical algorithms managed and overseen by\\nskilled individuals—known as \\ndata scientists\\n and \\nmachine learning\\nengineers\\n. This is one labor market where job opportunities are destined for', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Machine learning for beginners .pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='growth but where, currently, supply is struggling to meet demand. Industry\\nexperts lament that one of the biggest obstacles delaying the progress of AI is\\nthe inadequate supply of professionals with the necessary expertise and\\ntraining.\\nAccording to Charles Green, the Director of Thought Leadership at Belatrix\\nSoftware:\\n“It’s a huge challenge to find data scientists, people with machine\\nlearning experience, or people with the skills to analyze and use the\\ndata, as well as those who can create the algorithms required for\\nmachine learning. Secondly, while the technology is still emerging, there\\nare many ongoing developments. It’s clear that AI is a long way from\\nhow we might imagine it.”\\n \\n[2]\\nPerhaps your own path to becoming an expert in the field of machine learning\\nstarts here, or maybe a baseline understanding is sufficient to satisfy your\\ncuriosity for now. In any case, let’s proceed with the assumption that you are\\nreceptive to the idea of training to become a successful data scientist or\\nmachine learning engineer.\\nTo build and program intelligent machines, you must first understand\\nclassical statistics. Algorithms derived from classical statistics contribute the\\nmetaphorical blood cells and oxygen that power machine learning. Layer\\nupon layer of linear regression, \\nk\\n-nearest neighbors, and random forests surge\\nthrough the machine and drive their cognitive abilities. Classical statistics is\\nat the heart of machine learning and many of these algorithms are based on\\nthe same statistical equations you studied in high school. Indeed, statistical\\nalgorithms were conducted on paper well before machines ever took on the\\ntitle of \\nartificial intelligence\\n.\\nComputer programming is another indispensable part of machine learning.\\nThere isn’t a click-and-drag or Web 2.0 solution to perform advanced\\nmachine learning in the way one can conveniently build a website nowadays\\nwith WordPress or Strikingly. Programming skills are therefore vital to\\nmanage data and design statistical models that run on machines.\\nSome students of machine learning will have years of programming\\nexperience but haven’t touched classical statistics since high school. Others,\\nperhaps, never even attempted statistics in their high school years.

Instead,\\nSamuel observed that machines don’t require a direct \\ninput command\\n to\\nperform a set task but rather \\ninput data\\n.\\n \\nFigure 2: Comparison of Input Command vs Input Data\\n \\nAn example of an input command is typing “2+2” into a programming\\nlanguage such as Python and hitting “Enter.”\\n>>> 2+2\\n4\\n>>>\\nThis represents a direct command with a direct answer.\\nInput data, however, is different.

In the\\nsecond scenario, the machine assessed the physical features of previous\\nbaseball MVPs among various other features such as age and education.\\nHowever, in neither of these two scenarios was your machine explicitly\\nprogrammed to produce a direct outcome.

Ensemble modeling combines statistical\\ntechniques to create a model that produces a unified prediction. It is through\\ncombining estimates and following the wisdom of the crowd that ensemble\\nmodeling performs a final classification or outcome with better predictive\\nperformance. Naturally, ensemble models are a popular choice when it comes\\nto machine learning competitions like the Netflix Competition and Kaggle\\ncompetitions.\\nEnsemble models can be classified into various categories including\\nsequential, parallel, homogenous, and heterogeneous. Let’s start by first\\nlooking at sequential and parallel models. For sequential ensemble models,\\nprediction error is reduced by adding weights to classifiers that previously\\nmisclassified data. Gradient boosting and AdaBoost are two examples of\\nsequential models. Conversely, parallel ensemble models work concurrently\\nand reduce error by averaging. Decision trees are an example of this\\ntechnique.\\nEnsemble models can also be generated using a single technique with\\nnumerous variations (known as a homogeneous ensemble) or through\\ndifferent techniques (known as a heterogeneous ensemble). An example of a\\nhomogeneous ensemble model would be numerous decision trees working\\ntogether to form a single prediction (bagging). Meanwhile, an example of a\\nheterogeneous ensemble would be the usage of \\nk\\n-means clustering or a neural\\nnetwork in collaboration with a decision tree model.\\nNaturally, it is important to select techniques that complement each other.\\nNeural networks, for instance, require complete data for analysis, whereas\\ndecision trees can effectively handle missing values. Together, these two\\ntechniques provide added value over a homogeneous model. The neural\\nnetwork accurately predicts the majority of instances that provide a value and\\nthe decision tree ensures that there are no “null” results that would otherwise\\nbe incurred from missing values in a neural network. The other advantage of\\nensemble modeling is that aggregated estimates are generally more accurate', metadata={'source': '/content/sample_data/Machine learning for beginners .pdf', 'page': 97}),\n",

Four popular subcategories\\nof ensemble modeling are bagging, boosting, a bucket of models, and\\nstacking.\\nBagging\\n, as we know, is short for “boosted aggregating” and is an example\\nof a homogenous ensemble. This method draws upon randomly drawn\\ndatasets and combines predictions to design a unified model based on a\\nvoting process among the training data. Expressed in another way, bagging is\\na special process of model averaging. Random forest, as we know, is a\\npopular example of bagging.\\nBoosting\\n is a popular alternative technique that addresses error and data\\nmisclassified by the previous iteration to form a final model. Gradient\\nboosting and AdaBoost are both popular examples of boosting.\\nA \\nbucket of models\\n trains numerous different algorithmic models using the\\nsame training data and then picks the one that performed most accurately on\\nthe test data.\\nStacking\\n runs multiple models simultaneously on the data and combines\\nthose results to produce a final model. This technique is currently very\\npopular in machine learning competitions, including the Netflix Prize. (Held\\nbetween 2006 and 2009, Netflix offered a prize for a machine learning model\\nthat could improve their recommender system in order to produce more\\neffective movie recommendations. One of the winning techniques adopted a\\nform of linear stacking that combined predictions from multiple predictive\\nmodels.)\\nAlthough ensemble models typically produce more accurate predictions, one\\ndrawback to this methodology is, in fact, the level of sophistication.\\nEnsembles face the same trade-off between accuracy and simplicity as a\\nsingle decision tree versus a random forest.

For instance, the same code can be used to import a new dataset,\\npreview the dataframe, remove features (columns), remove rows, split and\\nshuffle the dataset, and evaluate mean absolute error.\\nhttp://scikit-learn.org is a great resource to learn more about other algorithms\\nas well as the gradient boosting used in this exercise.\\n \\nFor a copy of the code, please contact the author at\\noliver.theobald@scatterplotpress.com or see the code example below.

For beginners starting out in machine\\nlearning, there are a number of options. One is to source your own dataset\\nfrom writing a web crawler in Python or utilizing a click-and-drag tool such\\nas Import.io to crawl the Internet. However, the easiest and best option to get\\nstarted is by visiting kaggle.com.\\nAs mentioned throughout this book, Kaggle offers free datasets for\\ndownload. This saves you the time and effort of sourcing and formatting your\\nown dataset. Meanwhile, you also have the opportunity to discuss and\\nproblem-solve with other users on the forum, join competitions, and simply\\nhang out and talk about data.\\nBear in mind, however, that datasets you download from Kaggle will\\ninherently need some refining (through scrubbing) to tailor to the machine\\nlearning model that you decide to build. Below are four free sample datasets\\nfrom Kaggle that may prove useful to your further learning in this field.\\n \\nWorld Happiness Report\\nWhat countries rank the highest in overall happiness? Which factors\\ncontribute most to happiness? How did country rankings change between the\\n2015 and 2016 reports? Did any country experience a significant increase or\\ndecrease in happiness? These are the questions you can ask of this dataset\\nrecording happiness scores and rankings using data from the Gallup World\\nPoll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation questions\\nasked in the poll.\\n \\nHotel Reviews\\nDoes having a five-star reputation lead to more disgruntled guests, and\\nconversely, can two-star hotels rock the guest ratings by setting low\\nexpectations and over-delivering? Or are one and two-star rated hotels simply\\nrated low for a reason? Find all this out from this sample dataset of hotel\\nreviews. This particular dataset covers 1,000 hotels and includes hotel name,\\nlocation, review date, text, title, username, and rating.
